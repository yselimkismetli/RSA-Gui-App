## Encryption / Decryption

To encrypt texts or sentences, you must first create a public and a private key. When the application starts, keys (1024 bits) are generated automatically.
Then you choose an option for the key length and wait for the program to generate the keys. The keys are successfully generated and you can enter your word/phrase in the Plain Text area and then click the Encrypt button. Decrypt your text by typing the sentence into the "Encrypted Text" area and pressing the "Decrypt" button.

### Note
> _If you use a different key than the one used in the app, it won't be decrypted (e.g. if you keep the key before you used it and you think you'll use it later in the app, it won't work)._
